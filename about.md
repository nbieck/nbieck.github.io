I am currently a Master's degree student in the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree [IMLEX](https://imlex.org/) degree program.

Over the course of this program I will be studying at the University of Eastern Finland (Joensuu), Université Jean Monet (Saint-Étienne) and Toyohashi University of Technology.

My main fields of interest are computer graphics, as well as computer vision and machine learning.

I completed my Bachelor's degree at [DigiPen Institute of Technology's Spain Campus](https://www.digipen.es/) (spending my senior year at the main campus in Redmond, WA) in the RTIS (Real-Time Interactive Simulation) computer science program.
During this degree I found my passion specifically in the pursuit of computer graphics, both real-time and ray-traced, and I was the primary graphics programmer for several
of our student game projects.

In my free time, I enjoy board and video games, reading as well as climbing (mostly bouldering, with occasional top roping).

I also have an interest in languages, being conversational in German, English, French, Dutch and Japanese, as well as speaking some Spanish.
