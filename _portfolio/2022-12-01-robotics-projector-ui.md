This was a group project for the "Robotics&XR" course at UEF which I took as part of the IMLEX program.

We developed a system using a small laser projector and a Intel RealSense RGB-D camera that was able to project a distortior-corrected ui on an arbitrary flat surface. The user could then interact with the UI by tapping it the wall where it was projected.

The code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/nbieck/projector-ui-rxr).

We built it in Python, making use of [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) for hand-tracking.

Finally, here you can find a recording of me giving the final presentation of the project for the course:
