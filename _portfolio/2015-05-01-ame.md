Âme was a first-person horror game. It was developed during our junior year at DigiPen. The game was built entirely by the students, with all programming being done by the computer science students and all art assets (models, textures, etc.) being produced by the fine arts students.

The game was built from scratch using C++. I took on the role of primary graphics programmer, and built the entire rendering system using OpenGL.
I also researched and implemented several more advanced techniques such as portal culling in order to increase rendering performance, or a post-processed depth-of-field effect.

Sadly, the game is not available on DigiPen's game library, as we did not manage to deliver the level of gameplay quality that we (and the university) were hoping for.
