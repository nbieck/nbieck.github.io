In this project we attempted to create 3d models of real-world object using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields). Specifically, we wanted to be able
to create the model from a video of the object being held in the hand and rotated, while the camera is static.

This project was part of the "Complex Computer Rendering Methods in Real Time" as part of the IMLEX program's semester in France.
It was implemented in a team with my classmates [Fabiano Maia Manschein](https://bit.ly/manschein) and [Yuya Takagi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuya-takagi-943016252).
