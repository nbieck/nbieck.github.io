BlockLand is a 2D puzzle-platformer game that I worked on during my second semester at DigiPen. We developed the game using a simple game engine written in C that was
provided to us as part of the project work.

The aim of the game consists of successfully reaching the exit for the level, while collecting optional collectibles. The player accomplishes this by being able to "flip" tiles in a particular pattern under the
cursor. At the basic level this allows the player to turn passable air tiles into ground and vice versa. Later, other kinds of tiles are introduced, including cables that must be turned to allow a connection
to open doors, unflippable tiles, or turrets that will remove ground tiles when hit.

The game was developed by a group of students from the RTIS program, with some art assets being provided by students from the fine arts program.
