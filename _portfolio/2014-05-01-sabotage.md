"Sabotage: Give me my Pet back!" is a 2D Metroidvania game.

We developed it during our second year at DigiPen with a mixed team of computer sciene and art students. We built the game engine completely from scratch in C++, and all art assets were created by our fine arts colleagues.

During this project I was the team's main graphics programmer, building the rendering part of the engine from scratch using OpenGL.

You can download and play the game [here](https://games.digipen.edu/games/sabotage).
